## Creating Virtual Environment

This is preferable if you do not want to install the packages globally.

To activate the virtual environment, use:
```
. venv/bin/activate
```

## Installing dependencies

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the application

To run the application execute:
```
sh run.sh
```

## Deactivating Virtual Environment

To deactivate the virtual environment you can use:
```
deactivate
```
